## Project Goal

1. Chris, a Tesla fan, wants to see how much money he would have if he didn't spend $50,000 on a Tesla.
2. Ruby, an Apple fan, wants to see how much money she would have if she didn't spend $2,500 on an Apple Mac.

## How to know when you're done

The user should be able to:

1. Click on Apple's or Tesla's logo
2. Enter the amount of money they would like to invest. This value is in US dollars and there should be no decimals.
3. See the text "You would have $______ if you invested $________ in _____ five years ago."

## Requirements

1. Use Typescript
2. Add basic tests that will run when the developer runs `npm test`
3. Make sure the user can "tab" through the fields because the application should be [accessible](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html).
4. The user must select "Tesla" or "Apple" before inputing a dollar amount. The "money" field should be disabled until the user clicks on a company logo.
5. When a user clicks on a company, the text "Selected Dollar Amount" should be displayed in the browser console.
6. When a user inputs a dollar amount, the text "Selected Company" should be displayed in the browser console.
7. When a user clicks on a company logo, it should clear any previously intered values in the "Amount of Money" field.
