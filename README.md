# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

## Project Goal

The goal of this applicaiton is to see how much money you would have in five years if you investment $X dollars (USD) in Tesla or Apple.

## How to know when you're done

The user should be able to:

1. Click on Apple's or Tesla's logo
2. Enter the amount of money they would like to invest. This value is in US dollars and there should be no decimals.
3. See the text "You would have $______ if you invested $________ in _____ five years ago."

## Requirements

1. Use Typescript
2. Add basic tests that will run when the developer runs `npm test`
3. Make sure the user can "tab" through the fields because the application should be [accessible](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html).
